Short answers for the below questions suffice. If you want to alter your plan for your project (and obtain approval for the same), be sure to email your section leader directly!

#### What have you done for your project so far?

So far on our project we have developed the sudoku board and the playable sukdoku game that allows for user input and acknowledges correct/incorrect answers. As well as the ability for players to restart the game and play again as many times as they would like

#### What have you not done for your project yet?
We would like to develop different boards with different levels of difficultly that the player can choose, a celebration for when the user completes the board and putting super sudoku onto a website


#### What problems, if any, have you encountered?
We struggled with getting the program to alert the player when they input an incorrect solution so the board would end up unsolvable. We found a solution to this issue.
